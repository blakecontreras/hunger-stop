## Hunger Stop Style

We use the [AirBnB React Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react) for styling our React code.

We use the [AirBnB JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) for general JavaScript styling. Hunger Stop uses ES2015 with Babel as a transpiler.

We use a modified [Karma Commit Msg Style Guide](http://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/dev/git-commit-msg.html) for commit messages.

#### Commit Message Guidelines

- Commit messages should be written in the present tense with task and scope prefixed; e.g. "chore[deployment] Fix continuous deployment script".
- The first line of your commit message should be a brief summary of what the commit changes. Aim for about 70 characters max.
- If you want to explain the commit in more depth, following the first line should
 be a blank line and then a more detailed description of the commit. This can be
 as detailed as you want, so dig into details here and keep the first line short.
- If in doubt, refer to the [Karma Commit Msg Style Guide](http://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/dev/git-commit-msg.html)
